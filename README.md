I retired a few years ago from J&J/Janssen Pharmaceuticals, where I did software development (Spotfire) and clinical data management.  My degrees are in chemistry, and
I am interested in data management and analysis involving scientific or medical data.  I developed a neural network for review of genomic data, and I would be 
interested in further work in that area.
